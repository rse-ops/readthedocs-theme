# Installation


```{eval-rst}
.. note::
    We recommend installing into a
    `virtual environment <https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html>`_,
    which is an isolated Python environment that allows you to install
    packages without admin privileges.
```

## Install using pip

The simplest way to install from PyPi is using [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/) with the command:

```bash
$ pip install <yourproject>
```

You may need to use this instead, depending on your operating system:

```bash
$ python -m pip install <yourproject>
```
