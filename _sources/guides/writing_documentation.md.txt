# Writing documentation

## Types of documentation

- **Tutorials**: take a reader unfamiliar with the project through a series of
  steps to achieve something useful
- **How-to/examples**: more advanced versions of tutorials, for readers that
  already have some understanding of how the project.
- **Guides**: aim to explain a subject at a fairly high level
